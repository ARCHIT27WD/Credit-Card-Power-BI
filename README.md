### ðŸš€ Credit Card Customer Insights Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project
---

I developed a comprehensive Power BI report focused on Credit Card and Customer Insights by exporting data from a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin. The main objective of the report was to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, credit card usage, and overall financial patterns to support data-driven business decisions.

To begin with, I extracted and cleaned the relevant data using SQL queries in pgAdmin. This data included customer profiles, credit card transaction histories, credit limits, balances, and repayment records. Once the data was ready, I imported it into Power BI for modeling and visualization.

In Power BI, I designed an intuitive and interactive dashboard that presents key metrics through various visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and KPI indicators. The dashboard includes segments such as:
Customer Demographics: Displays customer age groups, gender distribution, and region-wise segmentation.
Credit Card Usage: Highlights total spending, credit utilization ratio, and most used card types.
Transaction Trends: Shows monthly and quarterly transaction volumes and growth trends.
Risk and Repayment Behavior: Identifies high-risk customers based on late payments, outstanding balances, and repayment patterns.

I used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures and calculated columns for enhanced analytics. Filters and slicers were also added to allow stakeholders to drill down into specific customer segments, time periods, or transaction types.

The final report was designed for both operational and strategic use, helping teams in finance, marketing, and risk management understand customer behavior more effectively. The insights provided can assist in improving customer retention strategies, optimizing credit offerings, and minimizing default risks.

Key Skills Used: SQL, DAX, Power BI, Data Modeling, Business Intelligence
